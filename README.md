## üìÉ Overview 
Radiate is a web application dedicated to fostering mental well-being by providing users with essential tools to manage and improve their mental health. Empowering individuals to understand, express, and seek support, Radiate combines a mood tracker, journal writing, appointment booking with a licensed psychologist, and a chatbot.

Radiate also provides psychologist with the flexibility to add their schedules, check on the booked appointments, as well as a dashboard to help them organize their work.

Aside from the users and psychologists, Radiate is complemented with an admin-role feature to manage users, psychologists, and the chatbot.
